#Logviewer

### Requirements
- Java 11

### Run the application

Because OpenJfx has a lot of operating system dependencies, see [here](https://openjfx.io/openjfx-docs), it's 
impractical to create an uber jar or installation.

To run the app simply clone the repository and run `./gradlew run` on the root folder. You must run this coomand 
with `Java11` in your path.
